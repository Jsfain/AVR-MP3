# AVR-General
Repository for general AVR modules


## Overview
This repository is intended for some general AVR-specific functions.  


### Currently Included
1) SPI.C / SPI.H : Source/header for interacting with the SPI port of an AVR.
2) USART.C / USART.H : Source/header for interacting with USART port of an AVR microcontroller.   
3) PRINTS.C / PRINTS.H : Source/header for printing integers (decimal, hex, binary) and strings to screen via the USART.


## Technology Details
* TARGET   : Written for ATmega1280, but should be easily portable, with slight modification, to other AVR targets.  
* LANGUAGE : C


## Implementation
See the source/header files for specifics.


## Who may use
Anyone.
